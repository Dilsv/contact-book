# Contact Book

![](assets/images/AmIResponsive.png)

[Live application can be found here](https://contact---book-20384d4aa8f4.herokuapp.com/)

This is a command-line interface application designed for a user to access their contacts, retrieve contacts through first name, contact number, age and country, edit existing contacts & add new contacts. This project has been designed for educational purposes and uses the Code Institutes practice terminal to run.

## UX
To begin the planning phase of this project, I began by prioritizing the User Experience (UX) and formulating the program's logic based on the user stories. Given that this is a command-line application, there is no incorporation of design aspects, as HTML and CSS have not been employed.

### Strategy
User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to easily access all of my contact's at once.
- As a user, I want to be able to retrieve a contact's information based upon their first name, mobile number, country and age.
- As a user, I want to add new contact information.
- As a user, I want to update an existing contact's information if there has been a change.

### Structure
![Flowchart of Python logic](assets/images/flowchart.png)

As you can see from the flowchart above the logic has been based around the four key user options, retrieving all contact's, adding contact's & editing existing contact's, and searching for contacts by specific category. Each path will take the user back to the beginning once finished.

## Features
The features included in this programme are listed in the main menu and they can be seen below:

![](assets/images/main-menu.png)

### Retrieve all contacts:
- From the main menu there is an option to Retrieve All Contacts, once the user has selected this all of the contacts will be printed to the terminal.

### Search Contacts:
- From the main menu there is an option to Search Contacts, once the user has selected this they are taken to another menu where they can choose what they would like to search by. 
    - First name
    - Mobile Number
    - Country
    - Age

- Once the user has selected the field to search by & input the name/number/country/age, if there is a correspondence this will be printed to the terminal.

### Add new contacts:
- On the main menu there is an option to Add New Contact.
- Once the user has selected this option they are then asked to input a value for First Name, Mobile Number, Country, Age.
- Once all fields have been entered the user will be asked if they would like to save the Contact or not. 
- If they do the contact will be saved, otherwise, they can go back to the main menu.

### Edit existing contacts:
- From the main menu there is an option to Edit Existing Contacts, once the user has selected this they will first be taken to search for the Contact by first name.
- The user will then be asked to enter '1' to continue the search.
- If there's a match found, this will be shown on the terminal and the user will be asked to asked which contact they would like to edit by name, number, country or age.
- The user will be asked which field they would like to edit and then be asked for the new information. 
- The new information will be saved to the spreadsheet once it is confirmed on the terminal by the user.

## Technologies Used

I have used several technologies that have enabled this design to work:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    - The entirety of the code in this application is composed using Python as the fundamental programming language, ensuring its complete functionality.
    - In addition to core Python I have used the following Python modules:
        - [Gspread](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/)
            - Used to access my google sheets document throughout the application, to access and edit data.

## Testing

### User Stories

*'As a user, I want to be able to easily access all of my contacts at once.'*  
This is one of the choices from the main menu, if the user selects option 1 all of the contacts are printed to the terminal.

![](assets/images/get-all.png)

*'As a user, I want to add new contact information.'*  
This is one of the choices from the main menu, if the user selects option 2, they are taken to add a new contact. The user is asked to input a value for First Name, Mobile Number, Country and Age.

![](assets/images/add-new.png)

*'As a user, I want to be able to retrieve a contacts information based upon their first name, mobile number, country and age.
This is one of the choices from the main menu, if the user selects option 3, they are taken to search their contacts by either name/number/country/age. If there is a match found it is printed to the terminal. 

![](assets/images/search- contact.png)

*'As a user, I want to update an existing contact's information if there has been a change.'*  
This is one of the choices from the main menu, if the user selects option 4, they are taken to search their contacts by first name. If there is a match found it is printed to the terminal and the user gets the option to edit a specific field.

### Input Validation

Given the significant reliance on user input for this program, it is crucial to validate these inputs thoroughly at each stage to guarantee the viability of the provided information. To achieve this, I opted for the pyinputplus module, leveraging its built-in validation features. Specifically, when users encounter a numbered menu and need to input their choice, I implemented the following function:
'def user_response(message, min_value, max_value):
    user_input = pyip.inputInt(prompt=message, min=min_value, max=max_value)
    return user_input'

I added the minimum and maximum value parameters to ensure that the user is only able to enter the numbers present in the menu, if they do not then the following error message is displayed:  

![](assets/images/invalid_msg.png)

 also incorporated validation for strings or integers to ensure that users input letters or numbers in the designated fields. If they fail to do so, the program displays the corresponding error messages.

! [](assets/images/invalid-msg3.png)

### Bugs and Fixes

In addition to my own testing of the programme I passed my code through the [Pep8](http://pep8online.com/checkresult) online validator which passed through with 0 issues:

![](assets/images/validation.png)

- When building this code, entering details with capitalised letters was an issue. I fixed this by removing code that made the entry case sensitive. 
- When building this code, it only accepted numbers and single words. This is an action I intend to improve in my future projects.
- When adding a new contact, it would accept a number as a country.
- When running the code, the program will not show saved contacts but will save new contacts.
- When saving or editing contact information, the numbers do not save with a '0'. This might be related to the excel spreadsheet.

### Improvements
- In my future projects, I intend on adding future features such as emails, addresses and last names.
- The initial application for this contact book was personal, but upon running into bugs that could not be tackled, I built the code for a business to use due to the vagueness of information input.

## Deployment

The master branch of this repository has been used for the deployed version of this application.

### Using Github & Gitpod

To deploy my command-line interface application, I had to use the [Code Institute Python Essentials Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template), as this enables the application to be properly viewed on Heroku using a mock terminal.

- Click the `Use This Template` button.
- Add a repository name and brief description.
- Click the `Create Repository from Template` to create your repository.
- To create a Gitpod workspace you then need to click `Gitpod`, this can take a few minutes.
- When you want to work on the project it is best to open the workspace from Gitpod (rather than Github) as this will open your previous workspace rather than creating a new one. You should pin the workspace so that it isn't deleted.
-  Committing your work should be done often and should have clear/explanatory messages, use the following commands to make your commits:
    - `git add .`: adds all modified files to a staging area
    - `git commit -m "A message explaining your commit"`: commits all changes to a local repository.
    - `git push`: pushes all your committed changes to your Github repository.

*Forking the GitHub Repository*

If you want to make changes to your repository without affecting it, you can make a copy of it by 'Forking' it. This ensures your original repository remains unchanged.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. In the top right corner of the page, click the Fork button (under your account)
3. Your repository has now been 'Forked' and you have a copy to work on

*Cloning the GitHub Repository*

Cloning your repository will allow you to download a local version of the repository to be worked on. Cloning can also be a great way to backup your work.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. Press the arrow on the Code button
3. Copy the link that is shown in the drop-down
4. Now open Gitpod & select the directory location where you would like the clone created
5. In the terminal type 'git clone' & then paste the link you copied in GitHub
6. Press enter and your local clone will be created.

### Creating an Application with Heroku

I followed the below steps using the Code Institute tutorial:

- The following command in the Gitpod CLI will create the relevant files needed for Heroku to install your project dependencies `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`. Please note this file should be added to a .gitignore file to prevent the file from being committed.

1. Go to [Heroku.com](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) and log in; if you do not already have an account then you will need to create one.
2. Click the `New` dropdown and select `Create New App`.
3. Enter a name for your new project, all Heroku apps need to have a unique name, you will be prompted if you need to change it.
4. Select the region you are working in.

*Heroku Settings*
You will need to set your Environment Variables - this is a key step to ensuring your application is deployed properly.
- In the Settings tab, click on `Reveal Config Vars` and set the following variables:
    - If using credentials you will need to add the credentials as a variable, the key is the name 'CREDS' and the value is the contents of your creds JSON
    - Add key: `PORT` & value `8000`
- Buildpacks are also required for proper deployment, simply click `Add buildpack` and search for the ones that you require.
    - For this project, I needed to add `Python` and `Node.js`, in this order.

*Heroku Deployment*
In the Deploy tab:
1. Connect your Heroku account to your Github Repository following these steps:
    1. Click on the `Deploy` tab and choose `Github-Connect to Github`.
    2. Enter the GitHub repository name and click on `Search`.
    3. Choose the correct repository for your application and click on `Connect`.
2. You can then choose to deploy the project manually or automatically, automatic deployment will generate a new application every time you push a change to Github, whereas manual deployment requires you to push the `Deploy Branch` button whenever you want a change made.
3. Once you have chosen your deployment method and have clicked `Deploy Branch` your application will be built and you should see the below `View` button, click this to open your application:

## Credits

I sourced my another_task function from Emma Wilson's Model Search (https://github.com/Emmacharleswilson/model-search) and also used this as a guideline when creating my validation functions using pyinputplus, retrieve all contact's function and add new contact function. 

Along with this I also used (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter8/) to help me with my validation using pyinputplus. 

All other code has been written by me.
